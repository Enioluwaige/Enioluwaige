        <h1>My Journey</h1>
        <p>
            From a young age, I've carried the weight of the world on my shoulders, stepping into a role that many would struggle with. 
            As the eldest, I became the backbone of my family, caring for my siblings and parent, taking on responsibilities far beyond my years. 
            While others around me were just starting to figure out their path, I was already deep in the journey of balancing family and education, 
            with an unwavering focus on my dreams.

            My time at university was nott just about getting a degreeâ€”it was about building the independence and resilience that now define me. 
            I learned to navigate lifes toughest challenges on my own, and every step I took, I did with strength and determination. 
            Today, I stand tall, proud of the woman I have become and the path I have carved out for myself.

            As I look ahead to becoming a cloud engineer, my dreams are bigger than just a job. 
            I envision a future where I am earning in dollars, achieving financial freedom, and creating a life that reflects the hard work and dedication 
            I've poured into every moment. My journey is not just about success; it is about proving to myself and the world that I can achieve anything 
            I set my mind to. I have come so far, and the future I am building is as bright as the determination that is gotten me here. 
            I'm moving forward, knowing that I have everything it takes to make my dreams a reality.
